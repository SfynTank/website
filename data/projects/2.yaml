title: Bridging the urban / rural gap
img: Urban_rural_gap
description: Contemporary city-life often means a lack of connection to nature, and specifically to our food. Convenience reins the life of a city-dweller, and a relationship with natural processes is lost. On the other end of the urban-rural nexus, we see youth leaving farms and moving into cities, as they perceive trade and farm work to be less attractive occupations. Rural food producers selling in urban food chains are confronted with issues like long travel, immense food waste, and unsustainable income. Can balcony beehives, rooftop gardens, and weekly farmersâ€™ markets work towards bridging the growing gap between city and hinterland? How can we maintain our relationship with the earth in a concrete jungle and dignify the life of food workers?
