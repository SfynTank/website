title: "Repurposing abandoned spaces for food production"
img: Repurposing_abandoned_spaces
description: Our world is well developed. Over-developed, in fact. Cleared land, new buildings and infrastructure are visible in every corner of the earth. What happens to an old subway line that goes out of service? Or to former factories, dilapidated homes, city lots, and decaying farmhouses? Can food communities re-imagine and utilize such spaces for food production to avoid clearing new land?
