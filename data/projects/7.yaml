title: Thinking outside the “can”

description: Slow Fish, the community within Slow Food that focus on sustainable fishery practices, believes there’s a lot of dignity in preserved fish. In a world that demands the freshest fish in every corner of the earth, preserved fish has gotten a bad rep. Whereas fresh tuna, salmon, and cod can be found year-round in the most unlikely of places, canned-fish is often considered poor quality, cheap, and met with suspicion. The demand for fresh fish like tuna and salmon are at the root of overfishing, farmed-fish, and multiple environmental, economic, and social hazards, when in fact canned-fish is a traditional waste-reduction and frugal-eating cultural habit for many seaside communities worldwide. How can we re-dignify preserved fish and think outside of the can?
