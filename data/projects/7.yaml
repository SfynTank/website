title: Thinking outside the “can”
img: Canned_fish
description: Slow Fish, the network within Slow Food that focuses on sustainable fishery practices, believes there’s a lot of dignity in preserved fish. In a world that demands the freshest fish in every corner of the earth, canned-fish is often considered poor quality and cheap. The demand for fresh fish, like tuna and salmon, are at the root of overfishing, farmed-fish, and multiple environmental, economic, and social hazards, when in fact canned-fish is a traditional waste-reduction method and frugal way to eat for many seaside communities worldwide. How can we re-dignify preserved fish and think outside of the “can”?
