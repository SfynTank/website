description: Today, food education has evolved a lot from the conventional, nutritional-pyramid model and come to include studies on organic vegetable growing and physiological health. Itâ€™s increasingly visible through campaigns, infographics, and school curricula, but food is a medium to reflect on many things outside of agriculture and nutrition: Through food, we can understand historical and cultural phenomenon, politics, and environmental happenings, even chemistry and algebra are inherent to food work. And working so closely with our food can instill a greater conscientiousness and value for nature and community. Can we come up with innovative and holistic means of food education for our youth in order to influence their lifelong behavior in society?
