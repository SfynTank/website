With the input of creatives--including interaction and product designers--alongside grassroots, gastronomic experts within the Slow Food Youth Network, you can impact future food initiatives! SFYN Tank is an experimental event aimed at squaring open-exchange of expertise at the center of food activism. Aimed at anyone in grassroots food work or creative sectors, we hope to engage food enthusiasts in collective problem-solving through design-thinking. Come attend our full day social-design workshop on September 24th, 2016 to employ a multidisciplinary approach that encompasses research, storytelling, idea-generation, and prototyping with a critical design eye to solve nine social problems our food system facesâ€“from shifting our idea of seafood consumption to democratizing food communication. Through open-exchange of expertise, out-of-the-box thinking, and a design approach, we truly can make meaningful impact on our global food system."
